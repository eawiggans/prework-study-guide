# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This is a webpage intended to assist students doing their bootcamp prework in accessing and studying notes on the four major topics covered. The topics covered are also the topics I learned about (very briefly) in completing this project: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

The site can be viewed normally on a browser to view notes broken down by topic. Users can access more content by pressing Comman+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) to open the DevTools Console in Chrome, where they will find the four topics as well as a suggestion for where to begin studying.
